# Godspeeding towards the best ILP formulation for Sudoku


To Mr. Forrest,

Please refer: https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc/discussions/516

I have been able to generate the files as suggested by you.

The input to the CBC would be the .lot and .lp file of the same Sudoku Size. (.mps files are also generated in case it is necessary)

I request your help to run some of these and suggest the way to run others.

This would allow me to understand the difference in solution times between the general Sudoku ILP with Binary Variables and my approach with Lotsize variables.

I just need proof that this method is far superior to the existing ILP with binary variables. In case this is found correct, I would be finishing off a paper for solving Sudoku with Lotsize/Bucket variables and would be eager to have you collaborate on that.

PS.: I was highly inspired by this Youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s) and understood that a faster Sudoku algorithm would help in Cancer research. I therfore have been trying to create a solution approach to Sudoku and using bucket variables flashed to me more than a year ago. I have been able to theoretically understand that the search space in my formulation would be much less. But computational proof has been elusive to me since for this I needed a Bucket/Lotsize variable and I am yet to recieve help from anywhere in this regard. (I had approached CBC maintainers multiple times as well as Gurobi staff.)

Your help would help develop newer research avenues into lotsize/Bucket variables as an extension of the Binary.

Thanking you in anticipation, yours faithfully
